Worked out programs from Machine Learning in Python by Michael Bowles

I have made a few changes to the programs.

Starting with Chapter 4, I wrote function definitions for the programs. The code in the book is very nice and elegant, but it doesn't organized the sections of each program using functions. I made functions for the different sections, which made it easier to debug.

Also, the programs have been modified to read data from disk. The programs in the book are written so that data is read through URLs, but since I am often without internet access on the BART, I downloaded the data to disk. The files that I downloaded were: sonar.all-data, winequality.csv, and abalone.dat.
